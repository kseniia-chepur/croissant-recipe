      <h1>How to make croissant</h1>
      <div class="recipe">
        <h3>Make the dough:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a mixing bowl with a dough hook, add in the flour, water, eggs,
            fresh yeast, salt, sugar, and honey.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set your mixer to a medium-slow speed and mix the ingredients until
            you have a homogeneous paste. Then, set your mixer on a higher speed
            and mix until the paste pulls away from the sides of the mixing
            bowl. Add the "beurre pommade" (Beurre pommade is butter that has
            been let come to room temperature (20 to 30°C / in the 60s F range)
            so that it is quite soft, like a face cream.) and knead until the
            dough comes together. Cover with a damp cloth, then let it rise at
            room temperature (24 to 25°C/75°to 77°F) for 1 hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flatten the dough to knock out the air, then roll it out into a
            large rectangle according to the width of the beurre de tourage and
            double its length. Place it in the freezer for 5 minutes, then in
            the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Place the beurre de tourage in the
            middle of the dough, fold the dough from each side up and over to
            cover the butter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn the edge of the visible butter to face you. Using a rolling
            pin, make a double fold: roll from bottom to top until you obtain a
            thickness of about 7 mm. Draw a small mark in the middle of the
            dough, fold the top and bottom into the middle, then fold the dough
            in half again like a wallet. Cover in plastic wrap and place the
            dough in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, make a single fold: roll the dough to 1 cm thick, rolling
            from bottom to top to form a long rectangle. Fold the top over a
            third of the dough and then fold the bottom over the top.
            Immediately roll out the dough to a thickness of 3.5 mm to start
            cutting and forming the croissants.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Make the egg wash:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and cream together.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Forming the croissants:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Cut triangles of 7 cm wide by 35 cm high. Roll the triangles on
            themselves starting from the base to form the croissants. Let rise
            for 2 hours at 26°C/77°F.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Finishing and baking:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 175°C/350°F.</li>
          <li>
            Place the croissants on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and use
            a brush to apply a thin layer of egg wash to each croissant. Bake
            for 15 min.
          </li>
          <li>
            When nicely golden, remove the croissants and let them cool on a
            rack.
          </li>
        </ol>
